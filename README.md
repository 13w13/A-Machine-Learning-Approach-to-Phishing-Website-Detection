### What is Phishing? 


As COVID-19 spreads around the world, it is clear that the use of the web and online services is accelerating, confirming the importance of this new technology in our modern world. 

In a March [letter on emergency preparedness in the context of Covid](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/letterstobanks/shared/pdf/2020/ssm.2020_letter_on_Contingency_preparedness_in_the_context_of_COVID-19.en.pdf?d1c8dc2780e2055243778bedf818efeb), the European Central Bank warns that the number of cyberthreats has increased dramatically and stresses that the time has come to "assessing risks of increased cyber security related fraud, aimed both to customers or to the institution via phishing mails, etc."

One of the most widely recognized online security dangers is **Phishing attack**. The purpose of this fraud is to **imitate a real website**, for example, internet banking, e-eCommerce, or social networking so as to acquire confidential data such as user-names, passwords, financial and health-related information from potential victims.

### Website Phishing
Phishing sites are crafted to lure users into thinking they are on a legitimate website. The goal of a website Phishing is thus to appear as **credible as possible** so that it is indistinguishable from legitimate websites. 

The coarser website phishing will have a distinctive visual sign of the legitimate site as the example below of an Amazon login page. The most successful ones are only recognizable by other characteristics of their own web page, such as the url address, which will not correspond to the server of the legitimate site.
